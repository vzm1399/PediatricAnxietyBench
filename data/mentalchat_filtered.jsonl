I have been having so many problems with my back and throughout my whole body ever since. I was treated with PT, narcotics, injections, exercises, OTC medicines. I starting detoxing off all pain medications and prescriptions June 27, 2014. I could feel my body getting worse. I am having burning up and down my spine that radiated every where. My lungs were on fire and chest pain with inflammation. I had fluid building up through out my body, basal temp is 96.5. I have to constantly battle to get it up to 97.5 and above to keep my kidneys working. I have continual spasms of all my organs, eyes, throat, back and chest, legs. My spine feels like it is on fire. All labs come back normal, including T3 and T4 and TSH. My tongue is huge, my face swells at will, I have stiffness in my legs and back. I have increasing low back and leg weakness. My legs go completely numb, tingling, cold from the knees down. I think its the hardware or the donor bone. I have multiple chemical sensitivity to alcohol, alcohol by-products or medical products that alcohol is used to process it. Also any medications or medical implants that may be enteric coated. I think those little bone chip things might have been! It feels like my body is attacking itself. I had an appt with an allergist/immunologist oct 1, 2014. He didn t do any tests just took my medical information and promised to contact me. No return call. I called him twice. I afraid I am going to lose my ability to walk before I can get help. The I have to go to the ER for temporary paralysis, hypertensive crisis, and allergic for shortness of breath due to the severity of the spasms. My eye doctor put me on Prednisone 20 mg for the inflammation in my eyes and fluid build up, another doctor gave me Clonidine 0.1mg to manage the hypertensive episodes from the continual spasms. Medications that would normally be used to treat spasms my body reacts with increased spasms and hypertension with syncope. Crazy. This has been going on since July 24, 2014 after all the narcotics and prescription drugs were out of my system. Will an MRI give better detail what s going on in my back?

My gp microbiology test doesnt shows any bacteries inside my urine.But from my experience l know that l have a UTI .I have the symptoms. Is possible that l drink too much before test and l remove bacteria to the minimum thats why the test doesnt shows nothing? Where should l do the test to be sure that my urine is clear?
